```
## Examples
Recover fonts from 2 .ass files and save them in the current folder
```
fontCollector -i "file1.ass" "file2.ass"
```
Take all the .ass files from the current folder and save the font in the current folder
```
fontCollector -i
```
Mux font from .ass file into an mkv
```
fontCollector -i "file1.ass" -mkv "example.mkv" -mkvpropedit "C:\Program Files\MKVToolNix\mkvpropedit.exe"
```

Mux the font from the .ass file into an mkv and delete the currently attached fonts.
```
fontCollector -i "file1.ass" -mkv "example.mkv" -mkvpropedit "C:\Program Files\MKVToolNix\mkvpropedit.exe" -d
```
## Variable Font
Since [Libass](https://github.com/libass/libass/issues/386) does not support [variable font](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/otvaroverview), this tool will automatically generate a [OpenType Font Collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/otff#font-collections). The generated collection is designed to simulate how [VSFilter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectVobSub)/[GDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Device_Interface) handles variable font.
## Acknowledgments
 - [fontmerge](https://github.com/WheneverDev/fontmerge) for the idea to automatically merge the font into the mkv.
 - [Myaamori-Aegisub-Scripts](https://github.com/TypesettingTools/Myaamori-Aegisub-Scripts) Without this tool, I probably could never have created the fontCollector. I got a lot of inspiration from his work.
 - [PyonFX](https://github.com/CoffeeStraw/PyonFX) I inspired myself from his setup.py to create mine.
 - [rcombs](https://github.com/rcombs) for her help with how VSFilter pick font when faux-bold need to be applied.
 - [assfc](https://github.com/tp7/assfc) for all the idea behind the font_loader.
