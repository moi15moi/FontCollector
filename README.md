```
Take all the .ass files from the current folder and save the font in the current folder
```
fontCollector -i  -o
```
Mux font from .ass file into an mkv
```
fontCollector -i "file1.ass" -mkv "example.mkv" -mkvpropedit "C:\Program Files\MKVToolNix\mkvpropedit.exe"
```

Mux the font from the .ass file into an mkv and delete the currently attached fonts.
```
fontCollector -i "file1.ass" -mkv "example.mkv" -mkvpropedit "C:\Program Files\MKVToolNix\mkvpropedit.exe" -d
```
## Variable Font
Since [Libass](https://github.com/libass/libass/issues/386) does not support [variable font](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/otvaroverview), this tool will automatically generate a [OpenType Font Collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/otff#font-collections). The generated collection is designed to simulate how VSFilter handles variable font.
## Acknowledgments
 - [fontmerge](https://github.com/WheneverDev/fontmerge) for the idea to automatically merge the font into the mkv.
 - [Myaamori-Aegisub-Scripts](https://github.com/TypesettingTools/Myaamori-Aegisub-Scripts) Without this tool, I probably could never have created the fontCollector. I got a lot of inspiration from his work.
 - [PyonFX](https://github.com/CoffeeStraw/PyonFX) I inspired myself from his setup.py to create mine.
